### Opinionated Makefile to build ES6 JS, JSX and Pug files

`n8-make` is a wrapper around [`make`](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
with a Makefile designed to compile JavaScript (and related) files for
usage with Node.js and the web browser.

By default, these file extensions get compiled into the `build` directory:

 * `.js` - Compiled via [Babel 6](https://babeljs.io) with support for [ES6](http://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/preset-es2015/) and [`async` functions](https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/transform-async-to-generator/)
 * `.jsx` - Same as `.js`, but with the [`react`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-preset-react) preset included as well
 * `.pug` - [Pug (a.k.a Jade) lang](http://jade-lang.com/) files get compiled into requireable template functions
 * `.json` - JSON files work as expected (use [`json-loader`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-loader) for client-side usage)


Installation
------------

Install with `npm`:

``` bash
$ npm install --save-dev n8-make
```


Usage
-----

The `n8-make` command invokes the system's `make` with its Makefile.
Any arguments you pass to `n8-make` get passed along to `make`.

The Makefile has a few built-in rules:

#### build (default)

``` bash
$ n8-make
# or
$ n8-make build
```

Compiles all files matching the extensions in the current directory
and nested directories.

A few paths are ignored by default, and will not be compiled:

 * `build` (or whatever `$(BUILDDIR)` get set to)
 * `node_modules`
 * `public`
 * `webpack.config.js`


### clean

``` bash
$ n8-make clean
```

Deletes the `build` directory (or whatever `$(BUILDDIR)` get set to).


### distclean

``` bash
$ n8-make distclean
```

Deletes the `node_modules` directory.


### Custom extensions

For every file that gets compiled, a specialized executable is invoked for each
file extension. For example, given the `.js` file extension, n8-make will invoke
`n8-make-js inputfile.js build/outputfile.js` and the output file is generated
from there.

You may override the default extensions by passing `EXTENSIONS` env to n8-make.
Say you wanted to use n8-make to compile `.coffee` files into js:

``` bash
$ n8-make build EXTENSIONS=coffee
```

But make sure you have a `n8-make-coffee` executable in your $PATH at this
point!

__*HINT!*__ n8-make inherits npm's `bin` directory, so you can utilize
`devDependencies` in your package.json file to include said executable.


### Extending the Makefile

If you would still prefer to have your own Makefile, say to add additional rules
or tweak existing variables, then you can easily extend the n8-make Makefile using
the following syntax:

``` make
include $(shell node -e "require('n8-make')")
```

This assumes that `n8-make` is a dependency of your project.


Debug
-----

To get debugging log output from `n8-make`, include "n8-make" in the `DEBUG` env
variable:

``` bash
$ DEBUG=n8-make n8-make build
n8-make: will compile extensions = js jsx pug
n8-make: ignoring paths = build node_modules webpack.config.js public
n8-make: source files = j.pug r.jsx t.js package.json
n8-make: output files = build/j.js build/r.js build/t.js build/package.json
â€¦
```
